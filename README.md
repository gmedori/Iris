# ðŸŒˆ Iris

Iris is a silly toy web browser that I built this week. I recorded a 5 minute video talking about why I built it:

## TL;DW

I built it to:

- try to get a primitive understanding of why web browsers are hard
- explore new APIs I haven't used before
- brush up on UIKit

Notes about the project and repo:

- I've been a primarily SwiftUI dev for about two years, and this project is all in UIKit. Therefore I was reacquainting myself with my UIKit style, so style and organization in the repo are all over the place.
- There are bugs and race conditions out the wazoo. I wasn't trying to build something perfect; rather, I was trying to learn. That said, I did my best to call out bugs where I spotted them. Search the repo for `TODO` to see them
- This is a prototype at best so there's no real architecture to speak of.

Regardless, I learned a lot from this project and I had a ton of fun noodling on WebKit.
